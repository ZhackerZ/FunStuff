## What does it do?

All updating is accomplished using plugins called _updaters_, which are run by command line or API, and can be installed globally, locally, or created in a local `updatefile.js`.

You can create your own [updaters](docs/updaters.md) using Update's API, or install updaters using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), to do things like:

* enforce conventions across all of your projects
* instantly update an old or inherited project to your latest personal preferences (convert tabs to spaces, convert from `jshint` to `eslint` or the other way around, or any other detail)
* reformat code to meet your standards
* convert a config file to a different format (json to yaml, yaml to json, etc)
* update files that are typically excluded from build cycles, and are often forgotten about after they're created. For example:
  - fix dates in copyrights, [licenses](https://github.com/update/updater-license) and banners
  - remove deprecated fields from [project manifests](https://github.com/update/updater-package)
  - update settings in [runtime config](https://github.com/update/updater-eslint) files, preferences in [dotfiles](https://github.com/update/updater-editorconfig)
* after initializing a new project with a project generator, like [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) or Google's Yeoman, you can "normalize" all of the generated files to use your own preferences

## Why update?

* **be more productive**: Update makes you more productive by eliminating time spent on things that _can be automated_, but typically aren't since they don't need to be done often, don't fit into the build cycle or a project's deliverables, or they're usually updated by hand. As code projects mature, time spent on these things tend to stay linear or increase as the size of a community grows. And this only compounds with each new project under your stewardship.
* **your way, instantly**: updaters can be published to and installed from npm, but you can also easily create your own [personal updaters](docs/symlinking-updaters.md). Once you're updaters are setup, projects under your maintenance will convert to the the conventions you prefer in milliseconds.
* **plugin ecosystem**: any plugins that work with [Base applications](#discovering-plugins) will work with Update. Which means you can use [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble), [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb), and [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) plugins, to name a few.

## Who should use Update?

* anyone who cares about having consistency across all of their projects
* developers or organizations with many projects under their stewardship
* agencies or consultants who maintain and/or create client projects and would like to reduce time spent on maintainance

## Getting started

The following instructions are intended to provide a basic demonstration of how Update works. Visit the links after this section for more information.

**1. Install update**

To use Update's CLI, `update` must first be installed globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --global update
```

This adds the `update` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from anywhere.

**2. Install an "updater"**

To see how updaters work, install `updater-example`:

```sh
$ npm install --global updater-example
```

**3. Create "example.txt"**

In the current working directory, create an empty file named `example.txt`.

**4. Run**

As a habit, when using `update` make sure your work is committed, then run:

```sh
$ update example
```

This appends the string `foo` to the contents of `example.txt`. Visit the [updater-example](https://github.com/update/updater-example) project for additional steps and guidance.

**Next steps**

* Browse the [documentation](docs)
* Learn about [updaters](docs/updaters.md)
* Learn about the [built-in updaters](docs/cli/built-in-updaters.md)

## Init

Tell Update's CLI to automatically run certain updaters every time the `update` command is given:

```sh
$ update init
```

You can run this command whenever you want to update your preferences, like after installing new updaters.

```console
$ update help

  Usage: update <command> [options]

  Command: updater or tasks to run

  Options:

    --config, -c      Save a configuration value to the `update` object in package.json
    --cwd             Set or display the current working directory
    --data, -d        Define data. API equivalent of `app.data()`
    --disable         Disable an option. API equivalent of "app.disable('foo')"
    --enable          Enable an option. API equivalent of "app.enable('foo')"
    --global, -g      Save a global configuration value to use as a default
    --help, -h        Display this help menu
    --init, -i        Prompts for configuration values and stores the answers
    --option, -o      Define options. API equivalent of `app.option()`
    --run             Force tasks to run regardless of command line flags used
    --silent, -S      Silence all tasks and updaters in the terminal
    --show <key>      Display the value of <key>
    --version, -V     Display the current version of update
    --verbose, -v     Display all verbose logging messages

  Examples:

    # run updater "foo"
    $ update foo

    # run task "bar" from updater "foo"
    $ update foo:bar

    # run multiple tasks from updater "foo"
    $ update foo:bar,baz,qux

    # run a sub-generator from updater "foo"
    $ update foo.abc

    # run task "xyz" from sub-generator "foo.abc"
    $ update foo.abc:xyz

    Update attempts to automatically determine if "foo" is a task or updater.
    If there is a conflict, you can force update to run updater "foo"
    by specifying its default task. Example: `$ update foo:default`
```

## Features

* **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [updaters](https://github.com/update/getting-started), [sub-updaters](https://github.com/update/getting-started) and [tasks](https://github.com/update/getting-started)
* **templates, scaffolds and boilerplates**: update a single file, initialize an entire project, or provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project using any combination of [templates, scaffolds and boilerplates](#templates-scaffolds-and-boilerplates).
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [swig](https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig) and [pug](http://jade-lang.com)
* **prompts**: asks you for data when it can't find what it needs, and it's easy to customize prompts for any data you want.
* **data**: gathers data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts and render templates
* **streams**: interact with the file system, with full support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins
* **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base](https://github.com/node-base/base), so any "smart" plugin can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.
* much more!
